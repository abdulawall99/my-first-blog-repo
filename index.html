    <ul>
      <li>
        Alcohol or alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, a psychoactive and toxic
        substance that can cause dependence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Worldwide, around <span class="heilight">2.6 million deaths</span> were caused by <span class="heilight">alcohol</span> consumption
        in 2019. Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable
        diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300 000 deaths from
        communicable diseases.
      </li>
      <li>
        The alcohol-attributable mortality was heaviest among men, accounting
        for 2 million deaths compared to 600 000 deaths among women, in 2019.
      </li>
      <li>
        An estimated 400 million people, or 7% of the world’s population aged 15
        years and older, lived with alcohol use disorders. Of this, 209 million
        people (3.7% of the adult world population) lived with alcohol
        dependence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alcohol consumption, even at low levels can bring health risks, but most
        alcohol related harms come from heavy episodic or heavy continuous
        alcohol consumption.
      </li>
      <li>
        Effective alcohol control interventions exist and should be utilized
        more, at the same time it is important for people to know risks
        associated with alcohol consumption and take individual actions to
        protect from its harmful effects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading2">Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Alcohol and alcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which is a psychoactive
        and toxic substance with dependence-producing properties. Alcohol has
        been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated
        with significant health risks and harms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption
        in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women.
        The highest levels of alcohol-related deaths per 100 000 persons are
        observed in the WHO European and African Regions with 52.9 deaths and
        52.2 deaths per 100 000 people, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        People of younger age (20–39 years) are disproportionately affected by
        alcohol consumption with the highest proportion (13%) of
        alcohol-attributable deaths occurring within this age group in 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to screening, brief intervention and treatment for people with
        hazardous alcohol use and alcohol use disorder remains very low, as well
        as access to medications for treatment of alcohol use disorders.
        Overall, the proportion of people with alcohol use disorders in contact
        with treatment services varies from less than 1% to no more than 14% in
        all countries where such data are available.
      </p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Health risks of alcohol use</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Alcohol consumption is found to play a causal role in more than 200
        diseases, injuries and other health conditions. However, the global
        burden of disease and injuries caused by alcohol consumption can be
        quantified for only 31 health conditions on the basis of the available
        scientific evidence for the role of alcohol use in their development,
        occurrence and outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing noncommunicable
        diseases such as liver diseases, heart diseases, and different types of
        cancers, as well as mental health and behavioural conditions such as
        depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alcohol consumption during pregnancy increases the risk of having a
        child with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), the most severe
        form of which is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is associated with
        developmental disabilities and birth defects. Alcohol consumption during
        pregnancy can also increase the risk of pre-term birth complications
        including miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Younger people are disproportionately negatively affected by alcohol
        consumption, with the highest proportion (13%) of alcohol-attributable
        deaths in 2019 occurring among people aged between 20 and 39 years.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="heading2">WHO response</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The Global alcohol action plan 2022–2030, endorsed by WHO Member States,
        aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through effective,
        evidence-based strategies at national, regional and global levels. The
        plan outlines six key areas for action: high-impact strategies and
        interventions, advocacy and awareness, partnership and coordination,
        technical support and capacity-building, knowledge production and
        information systems, and resource mobilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementation of global strategy and action plan will accelerate global
        progress towards attaining alcohol-related targets under the Sustainable
        Development Goal 3.5 on strengthening the prevention and treatment of
        substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of
        alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability,
        availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through
        cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also
        of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people
        living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to
        alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing
        comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for
        those in need.
